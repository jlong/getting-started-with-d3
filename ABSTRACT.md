Getting started with D3
-----------------------

D3 has emerged as the premier visualization library for JavaScript. With an API
that is similar to jQuery, D3 makes it easy to build complex HTML or SVG
visualizations. In fact, regardless of your framework choice (jQuery, Ember,
React, Angular, etc), almost all modern charting libraries are built on top of
D3. In this talk, you'll learn about getting started with D3. Weâ€™ll start with
the basics and work our way up to building a fully functional animated bar
graph.
